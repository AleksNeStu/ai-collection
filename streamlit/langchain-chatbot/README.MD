1. Basic Chatbot
   Functionality: A basic chatbot responds to user inputs with pre-defined answers or based on simple rules or patterns. It lacks deep understanding and works well for straightforward queries.

Example: A FAQ bot that provides answers from a fixed set of responses, like customer service bots handling common queries (e.g., "What are your opening hours?").

Implementation: Often done using keyword matching, if-else rules, or pattern recognition.

2. Context-Aware Chatbot
   Functionality: This type of chatbot remembers past interactions within a session to maintain context. It can handle more dynamic conversations where previous user inputs are relevant.

Example: A chatbot that helps with booking a flight—asking for destination, dates, and then referencing these when recommending flights.

Implementation: Usually requires a state management system where user intents and entities (context) are stored across turns in a conversation.

3. Chatbot with Internet Access
   Functionality: This chatbot can retrieve real-time information from the web or external sources, making it dynamic and capable of answering up-to-date questions.

Example: A chatbot that can provide current weather, news updates, or stock prices by fetching information from the internet.

Implementation: It needs integration with external APIs (e.g., weather, news, or search engines) and can require web scraping or API queries to get real-time data.

4. Chat with Your Documents
   Functionality: This type of chatbot allows users to upload or link documents (e.g., PDFs, Word files) and then interact with them conversationally. The bot can search, extract, or summarize information from the documents.

Example: A chatbot that helps users navigate through legal documents by finding relevant sections or providing summaries.

Implementation: Document parsing tools like OCR (if scanned documents) or natural language processing (NLP) models that are fine-tuned to understand and extract information from documents.

5. Chat with SQL Database
   Functionality: This chatbot can query an SQL database based on user input, retrieve data, and present the results in a conversational way.

Example: A chatbot for a sales team that queries a customer database to provide sales figures, customer details, or inventory status based on user requests.

Implementation: SQL queries are generated dynamically based on user input (intent), and the chatbot interfaces with a backend database. It requires an understanding of both SQL query syntax and database schema.

6. Chat with Website
   Functionality: This chatbot can interact with the content of a specific website. It might retrieve information, extract content from web pages, or allow users to ask questions about the content of a site.

Example: A chatbot that can answer questions about the content of a corporate website, providing details on services, company information, or product offerings.

Implementation: Web scraping or APIs that allow the chatbot to fetch and interact with a website’s data, paired with NLP to understand user queries and extract relevant web content.
