1. Chatbot
   A Chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human conversation. It can communicate through text or voice and is often powered by AI to understand and generate responses based on user inputs. The chatbot typically performs tasks like answering FAQs, assisting with customer support, or providing personalized services. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret and respond appropriately.

Example use case: A chatbot on an e-commerce site can help users navigate products or answer questions about orders.
2. File Q&A
   File Q&A refers to the process of interacting with a chatbot or AI to ask questions about the contents of a file (e.g., PDFs, CSVs, Word documents). This is especially useful when dealing with large documents, where the AI can pull relevant information based on user queries.

Example: Upload a legal contract, and the chatbot can answer specific questions like "What is the contract‚Äôs expiration date?" or "What is the penalty clause?".
3. Chat with Search

Chat with search
In this example, we're using StreamlitCallbackHandler to display the thoughts and actions of an agent in an interactive Streamlit app. Try more LangChain ü§ù Streamlit Agent examples at github.com/langchain-ai/streamlit-agent.

Chat with Search integrates real-time search capabilities into the chatbot experience. This allows the chatbot to search external databases, websites, or documents to find relevant information and return it to the user during the conversation.

Example: A chatbot that can search the web for the latest news on a specific topic when asked.
4. Langchain Quickstart
   LangChain is a framework designed to build language model-based applications, particularly those that involve chaining together multiple AI models, interacting with external data sources (e.g., APIs, databases), or working with complex logic. The LangChain Quickstart guides users on how to set up and build applications using this framework.

Example: Building a chatbot that retrieves and summarizes information from multiple knowledge sources using LangChain.
5. Langchain PromptTemplate
   The Langchain PromptTemplate is a utility within LangChain used to create flexible and reusable prompt templates for large language models. You can define placeholders within a template and fill them with dynamic data, allowing for a consistent structure while adapting to different inputs.

Example: A template could be created for summarizing a document, where the document content is dynamically inserted into a predefined structure like, "Summarize the following content: {document_text}".
6. Chat with User Feedback


Chat with feedback (Trubrics)
In this example, we're using streamlit-feedback and Trubrics to collect and store feedback from the user about the LLM responses.


Chat with User Feedback refers to a system where users can provide real-time feedback during their interaction with a chatbot. This feedback loop helps to improve the chatbot‚Äôs responses or performance by understanding whether the user was satisfied with the response, thus allowing for continual refinement.

Example: After receiving a response, the chatbot asks, ‚ÄúDid this answer your question?‚Äù If the user says "No", the bot can learn or adapt the answer accordingly.
